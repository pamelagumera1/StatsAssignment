#What I found out is that the relationship between these two variables is linear.

### Results shows that it shows a positive line which shows that as the TV expense increases, sales has also increases but it does not necessarily 
## mean that an increase in TV expense also increase sales. Take for example: TV expense of 85.7 only drove 13.3 in sales and 96.2 only drove 12.1 increase.
